DigiLog-N is software implementation of the architecture outlined in our proposal.

To install the software:
	Create a Python virtual environment for DigiLog-N using virtualenv, venv, etc.
	Install this software's dependencies, using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
	Install this software into your virtual environment, using 'pip install .' from this project's root directory.

To use the software:
	Once this software has been installed in your virtual environment, support classes such as PlasmaReader will be available to your software projects, and the demo will be available as a command-line program. Simply type 'demo' to run the software.
	The software is hard-coded to expect the location of the Plasma file in '/tmp/plasma'.
